##### Overview
This project is a web-based application that provides restaurant reviews. My contribution was to make the website fully responsive and cache the content for offline use.
###### My tasks: 
* Setup the maps on the screen using the MapBox API.
* Improve responsiveness for different viewports.  
* Expand accessibility adjusting the tab index order and applying ARIA labels.
* Implement page caching for offline experience using the Service Worker Web API as described on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers).

Note: UI frameworks such as jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, etc. were not allowed for this project as per Udacity's mandate.
